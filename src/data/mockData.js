    content: `
      <h2>Introduction to Green Chemistry</h2>
      <p>The chemical industry is undergoing a revolutionary transformation towards sustainability. Green chemistry, also known as sustainable chemistry, is designing chemical products and processes that reduce or eliminate the generation of hazardous substances.</p>
      
      <h2>Key Principles of Green Chemistry</h2>
      <p>The twelve principles of green chemistry provide a framework for designing environmentally benign chemical processes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Prevention of waste</li>
        <li>Atom economy</li>
        <li>Less hazardous chemical syntheses</li>
        <li>Safer chemicals by design</li>
        <li>Safer solvents and auxiliaries</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Current Trends and Innovations</h2>
      <p>Recent advances include the development of bio-based feedstocks, catalytic processes that operate under mild conditions, and the use of renewable energy sources in chemical manufacturing.</p>
      
      <h2>Looking Forward</h2>
      <p>The future of sustainable chemistry lies in circular economy approaches, where waste from one process becomes the input for another, creating closed-loop systems that minimize environmental impact.</p>

    content: `
      <h2>Understanding Circular Economy</h2>
      <p>The circular economy is an economic model that aims to eliminate waste and maximize resource efficiency by keeping products, materials, and resources in use for as long as possible.</p>
      
      <h2>Application in Chemical Industry</h2>
      <p>Chemical manufacturers are implementing circular economy principles through:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Waste-to-resource conversion</li>
        <li>Product design for recyclability</li>
        <li>Industrial symbiosis</li>
        <li>Closed-loop manufacturing</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Success Stories</h2>
      <p>Leading companies are already demonstrating the viability of circular approaches, with some achieving zero waste to landfill and significant reductions in raw material consumption.</p>

      <h2>What are Bio-Based Materials?</h2>
      <p>Bio-based materials are derived from renewable biological resources rather than finite fossil resources. They represent a significant opportunity for the chemical industry to reduce its environmental footprint.</p>
      
      <h2>Types of Bio-Based Feedstocks</h2>
      <p>Common sources include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Agricultural residues</li>
        <li>Forestry waste</li>
        <li>Algae biomass</li>
        <li>Food waste</li>
        <li>Municipal solid waste</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Applications and Benefits</h2>
      <p>Bio-based materials are being used to create biodegradable plastics, natural dyes, sustainable surfactants, and many other products that traditionally relied on petrochemical feedstocks.</p>
